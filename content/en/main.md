# Eat less, Move more

Forget everything you heard about losing weight. The only way to lose weight is **burn more calories than you consume**. To burn more calories - you move more. To consume fewer calories - you eat less.

It's that simple. You don't need green diets, carrot diets, or any other fad diets. You also don't need to hit the gym for hours every day. Everyday activity can be enough. Also, don't expect quick results. You spent years putting on the weight, and it will take time to lose it. If you expect to see changes overnight, you will likely become discouraged and give up. So don't be in a hurry. Just be consistent.

## Eat less

How to eat less? Harder than it sounds. But not really.

1. Buy kitchen scales
2. Try to get used to weighing your food portions and tracking calories with a food diary or app for a week. It will help you to understand portion sizes better and avoid overeating. Also, you will find out which products contain more calories than you think. A lot of people stop eating junk food when they realize how many calories are in it.
3. After that, count your estimated daily calorie needs. You can use this website - [Calorie Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html)
4. Use the information from the calculator to set a realistic calorie target for weight loss.
5. From now on, track your daily calorie intake and make sure to stay within your target. Remember, don't try to cut calories too drastically. Aim for a sustainable deficit.

### Hacks:

1. Use smaller plates and bowls - it tricks your brain into thinking you're eating more
2. Eat slowly and chew thoroughly - it takes 20 minutes for your brain to register fullness
3. Drink water before meals - it helps you feel fuller
4. Fill half your plate with vegetables - they're low calorie and filling
5. Stop eating when you're 80% full, not completely stuffed
6. Don't keep junk food in your house - if it's not there, you can't eat it
7. Have healthy snacks readily available (e.g., apples, carrots) to avoid unhealthy choices. Some people gain weight just from mindless snacking. Let the snacks contain fewer calories.

## Move more

Moving more doesn't mean becoming a marathon runner. It means being less sedentary than you are now.

1. Start with walking. Set a goal of **7,000 steps per day**. Your smartphone can track this.
2. Once 7,000 steps feels easy, bump it up to **10,000 steps**.

### Hacks:

1. Take the stairs instead of elevators
2. Park further away from entrances
3. Walk or bike for short errands instead of driving
4. Take walking breaks during work
5. Walk while talking on the phone

## Tools you need

- **Kitchen scale** (to weigh food)
- **Calorie tracking app** (Yazio, MyFitnessPal, or any similar app)
- **Your smartphone** (already tracks steps)

That's it. You don't need expensive equipment, supplements, or gym memberships. Remember, eat less, move more.
